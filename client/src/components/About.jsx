        <div className="about-text">
          <p>I was born in Los Angeles and grew up in Compton, CA. 
            After many attempts at traditional higher education, 
            I decided to take a different route and enter the field of childcare. 
            Starting off as a nanny, I eventually evolved into a Household Manager 
            and later pivoted into birth work, becoming a postpartum doula. 
            These roles allowed me to support families in meaningful ways and build 
            lasting relationships. While working in this field, 
            I met my wife, and we are currently planning to grow our family.
             Additionally, I have been involved in community initiatives focused on 
             supporting new parents and advocating for better maternal care.
